# TODOs

* [x] explicit hyphens & dashes
  * [x] bug: lime-tree => lime--tree
* [x] punctuation:
* [x] super-long hyphenation test doesn't pass
* [x] fixed-width options (terminal)
* tests: assert Knuth's break point
* impossible solution should fail early: longest token larger than desired width
* justified / center 
* attributes (e.g. ANSI esc)
* punctuation with special rule: ",", ";", ":" -> for now only a basic, uniform processing is being carried out
